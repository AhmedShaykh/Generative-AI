# A Challenge: FastAPI Event Driven Microservices Development With Kafka, Zookeeper, Docker Compose, and Poetry 

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a popular design pattern for building applications that react to events.  Here's a breakdown of why it's used and its pros and cons:

**Why use EDA?**

* **Loose coupling:**  Components are independent and communicate through events,  making them easier to develop, maintain, and update. 
* **Scalability:**  EDA can handle increased load by adding more consumers to process events.
* **Real-time processing:**  Events can trigger actions as they happen, enabling real-time applications.

**Advantages of EDA**

* **Flexibility:**  EDA can accommodate changing business needs by adding new event types.
* **Resilience:**  If one part of the system fails, others can continue processing events.
* **Concurrency:**  Multiple consumers can process events simultaneously.

**Disadvantages of EDA**

* **Complexity:**  Designing and debugging EDA systems can be more complex than traditional architectures.
* **Monitoring:**  Troubleshooting issues can be challenging due to asynchronous communication.
* **Testing:**  Testing event-driven systems can require specialized tools and techniques.

Overall, EDA is a powerful approach for building scalable and responsive applications.  However, it's important to consider the trade-offs before implementing it.

## The Evolution of Kafka Architecture: From ZooKeeper to KRaft

https://romanglushach.medium.com/the-evolution-of-kafka-architecture-from-zookeeper-to-kraft-f42d511ba242

As of Kafka 3.5, the ZooKeeper mode is being deprecated, and it will be completely removed from Kafka with the release of Kafka 4.0.

# Kafdrop â€“ Kafka Web UI 

This is a popular open-source web UI specifically designed for viewing Kafka topics, messages, brokers, consumer groups, and even lets you create new topics. It's known for being lightweight, easy to set up, and supports secure connections. You can find the project on Github here:
