# Serverless Containers

Kubernetes is today's go-to platform for managing large groups of containers thanks to benefits such as faster development and release timelines, greater team productivity, reduced downtime risk, and easier troubleshooting with the rollback option.

However, because of its complexity, Kubernetes calls for in-house experts able to continuously manage and maintain the infrastructure, placing this solution out of reach for many smaller businesses.

A container orchestration solution brings together the benefits of serverless architecture and the quick performance of the container orchestration system Kubernetes. For example, Azure serverless containers allow cloud customers to run containers without the need for servers or system infrastructure.

That way, businesses can get containers up and running in minutes, with just enough flexibility to meet their needs. They also won’t have to worry about manual updates again.

Engineers can concentrate on their code while a third-party cloud provider provisions, maintains, and secures the hardware. You just pay for the compute resources you use, and the solution is more scalable and often less expensive than Kubernetes or traditional deployments.


## Adoption of Serverless Containers Continues to Increase

Serverless container adoption is on the rise—**46 percent** of container organizations now run serverless containers, up from 31 percent two years ago. It is being hypothesize that as organizations matured their container usage, many have adopted serverless containers as the next step in reducing operational overhead, increasing development agility, and lowering costs. Cloud providers fully provision and manage the infrastructure used by serverless containers, which enables teams to quickly launch new workloads while addressing the ongoing challenges of optimizing resource utilization.
