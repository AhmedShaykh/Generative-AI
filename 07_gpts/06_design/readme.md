# Designing GPTs

Our proposed process for designing and developing custom GPTs is comprehensive and well-structured, combining user-centric design thinking, behavior-driven development (BDD), and creative script generation to identify actions and APIs. Here's a breakdown and evaluation of our approach with examples to illustrate how each step integrates:

### Step 1: Focus on User through Design Thinking

**Empathize and Define:**
Start by understanding the user's needs, preferences, and challenges through interviews, surveys, and observations.

*Example:* 
- **Empathize:** Conduct workshops with potential users to understand their pain points when using existing AI solutions.
- **Define:** Identify key issues such as "Users find it difficult to get personalized responses for their specific industry-related queries."

**Ideate:**
Brainstorm potential solutions and features that could address the defined problems.

*Example:* 
- Generate ideas like "a GPT that can learn from industry-specific documents" or "a GPT that offers a task management interface integrated with user preferences."

**Prototype and Test:**
Create and test prototypes with real users to gather feedback.

*Example:* 
- Develop a simple prototype of the GPT interface and functionality, and test it with a small user group. Gather feedback on usability and relevance.

### Step 2: Define Behavior Using BDD

BDD helps define the expected behavior of the GPT in a way that’s clear and understandable for all stakeholders.

**Write BDD Scenarios:**
Define the behavior of the GPT in the form of Given-When-Then scenarios.

*Example:* 
- **Scenario:** Personalized Task Management
  - **Given**: A user has signed in and provided their preferences.
  - **When**: The user asks for a new task to be added.
  - **Then**: The GPT suggests tasks based on the user's preferences and past behavior.

### Step 3: Generate Movie Scripts from BDD Documentation

Turning BDD scenarios into movie scripts helps visualize interactions and user journeys in a more narrative and engaging way.

*Example:* 
- **BDD Scenario**: Personalized Task Management
  - **Movie Script**:
    - **Scene 1**: User logs in and the GPT greets them with a summary of pending tasks.
    - **Scene 2**: User asks, "What's my next task?" The GPT analyzes past tasks and user preferences.
    - **Scene 3**: GPT responds, "Based on your schedule, I suggest you focus on the marketing report next."

### Step 4: Identify GPT Actions (APIs) from BDD and Movie Scripts

Identify specific actions and APIs required to implement the behaviors and interactions described in BDD scenarios and movie scripts.

*Example:* 
- **From the Scenario and Script**:
  - **API Action 1**: Authenticate user and retrieve preferences.
  - **API Action 2**: Analyze past tasks and preferences to suggest next task.
  - **API Action 3**: Update task status and user preferences based on interaction.

### Integrating the Steps

1. **Start with Design Thinking:**
   - Gather user insights and define problems.
   - Ideate solutions and create prototypes.
   - Test and refine prototypes based on user feedback.

2. **Move to BDD:**
   - Write clear, behavior-focused scenarios based on user insights and defined problems.
   - Use these scenarios to specify detailed requirements and expected outcomes.

3. **Generate Movie Scripts:**
   - Convert BDD scenarios into narrative scripts to visualize user interactions.
   - Ensure the scripts cover all possible user journeys and interactions.

4. **Identify GPT Actions:**
   - Extract required actions and APIs from the BDD scenarios and movie scripts.
   - Define the technical implementation for each action/API.

### Example Process Flow

1. **Design Thinking Phase:**
   - User Research → Problem Definition → Ideation → Prototyping → Testing

2. **BDD Phase:**
   - Scenario Writing → Documentation Review → Scenario Refinement

3. **Script Generation Phase:**
   - Scenario Conversion → Script Writing → Script Review

4. **Action Identification Phase:**
   - Script Analysis → Action/ API Listing → Technical Specification

### Conclusion

Your approach of combining design thinking, BDD, and script generation is robust and user-focused, ensuring that the GPT developed is both functional and aligned with user needs. Each step builds upon the previous one, creating a seamless process from understanding user needs to technical implementation. By following this structured approach, you can create custom GPTs that are highly effective and user-friendly.
